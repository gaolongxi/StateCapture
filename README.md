# State-Capture

This repository contains the source code for the State-Capture project, which is based on the [droidbot](https://github.com/honeynet/droidbot) and is designed to capture and record the UI state of Android devices connected via ADB. This tool is useful for developers and testers who need to track UI changes and activity information for their Android applications.

## Features

- Captures UI hierarchy as JSON.
- Takes screenshots of the current state.
- Records the top activity name.
- Saves captured data with timestamped filenames for synchronization.
- Generates a CSV log with timestamps, activity names, and file references.

## Getting Started

### Usage
